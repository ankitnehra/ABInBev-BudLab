Calculate ETc by canopy measurements and compare with ETc derived from climate conditions to find crop water stress level.
Water stress thus obtained can be used to tell the grower that he needs to irrigate that part and can be used with some deep
learning techniques to calculate the likelihood of a disease.
Use the light sensor to detect any diseases already present.
http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/resources/000/263/345/G44_HGCA_Barley_Disease_Management_Guide_2011.pdf is a good resource for 
disease symptoms. Think about how the light sensor can be used to detect these symptoms.

Stretch goal - Use a drone with mounted camera and gps to survey fields and predict yield as well as use image processing to
detect diseases and schedule disease-spraying.
